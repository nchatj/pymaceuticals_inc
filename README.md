Observations:
1. The average tumor volume has a strong positive relationship with mouse weight for mice in the Capomulin regimen (p = 0.84).
2. The lowest mean final tumor volume across the four regimens of interest is from the Ramicane regimen, whilst Infubinol has the highest mean final tumor volume.
3. For mouse i557, the tumor volume initially sees a small decrease as the result of the Capomulin regimen, followed by a steady increase in volume after the first timepoint.
